The issue you reported is dus to a bug in Neo4j 3.5.0 . I reported it a couple of days ago ... 
https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/issues/12097


Workaround: 
Change the cypher statement in node with internal id 19. 
You can use the Node lookup button in the top-left panel.  
Change TIMESTAMP() to timestamp() and it should work.
